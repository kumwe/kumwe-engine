# Native draft handoff

This reviewable native implementation candidate is not a stable release or App adoption.
The five-module architecture, exact test ownership and downstream release barriers remain mandatory.

## Runtime candidate NRM-2026-042

The candidate implements immutable formula plans, complete normalized document preparation/computation/
validation, typed value and source-instance handling, normalized report materialization including converted
values, and GenericV1 canonical encoding with streaming SHA256. Patched PCRE2 and pinned Unicode data
preserve the owner behavior. The public ABI owns plans, output buffers and cooperative cancellation.
Exact corpus, architecture, lifecycle and independent binding gates remain mandatory. Host normalization,
authority, persistence, provisioning and App cutover remain with their named owners.
